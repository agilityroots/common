# Common Tools

This is a repository of scripts/tools for reuse across the code-base.

## How to Use

You can pick and choose the scripts you want and run them standalone.

Another way is to download-and-run them in one go, as part of a Vagrant provisioning flow. (Read [Vagrant Shell Provisioning](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/shell.html) for more. )
